# python-pandas-toolkit

Welcome to **python-pandas-toolkit**. This repository is designed as a guide for anyone eager to learn about Pandas for data manipulation, wrangling, and analysis. Here, youâ€™ll find everything you need to get started with Pandas, covering fundamental concepts and some common scenarios you may encounter. My goal is to provide a robust toolkit that equips you to handle a wide range of data tasks using Pandas.

If you have anything to add or any improvements, feel free to contribute by opening a pull request. I would love to collaborate!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project repository and create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate your environment by running `.venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Tutorial Breakdown

The repository is set up using Jupyter Notebooks with all the content to allow those to follow along. The tutorials can be found in the `tutorials` folder and cover the following topics:

1. reading_data.ipynb - this covers reading in various file types (csv, xlsx, ods) and reading data directly from urls.
2. data_cleaning.ipynb - this covers handling null values, duplicates, data types and string operations.
3. data_transformation.ipynb - this covers filtering, modifying columns, reshaping data (merging, pivoting, unpivoting) and aggregating data.

If you are a complete beginner, I would advise following the Notebooks in this order.
